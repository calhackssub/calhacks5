happy Halloween I have a little kid at 

2
00:00:4,200 --> 00:00:7,000
home so Halloween's a big deal but I've 

3
00:00:7,000 --> 00:00:9,500
also been reading a lot of dr. Seuss 

4
00:00:9,500 --> 00:00:12,800
like a lot of dr. Seuss and this 

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,700
morning I discovered that dr. Seuss actually wrote 

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,100
a poem about cs61a messing relevant so I 

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,600
thought I'd share it with you computers and 

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,700
science how did they meet computers are cool 

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,600
and science is neat but then one day 

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,500
they must have teamed up on the street 

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,500
and created this course in which I have 

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,600
a seat and it's hard the projects are 

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,300
tough to complete and scheme seems like more 

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,700
of a trick than a treat and the 1
